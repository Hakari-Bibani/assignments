    **Assignment: Week 1 â€“ Mapping Coordinates and Calculating Distances in Python**

    **Objective:**  
    In this assignment, you will write a Python script to plot three geographical coordinates on a map and calculate the distance between each pair of points in kilometers.

    **Task Requirements:**  
    1. Plot the Three Coordinates on a Map:  
       - Use Python libraries to plot the points on a map.  
       - The map should visually display the exact locations of the coordinates.  
    2. Calculate the Distance Between Each Pair of Points:  
       - Calculate the distances between the three points in kilometers.  

    **Coordinates:**  
    - Point 1: Latitude: 36.325735, Longitude: 43.928414  
    - Point 2: Latitude: 36.393432, Longitude: 44.586781  
    - Point 3: Latitude: 36.660477, Longitude: 43.840174  

    **Expected Output:**  
    1. A map showing the three coordinates.  
    2. A text summary showing the calculated distances (in kilometers) between:  
       - Point 1 and Point 2.  
       - Point 2 and Point 3.  
       - Point 1 and Point 3.
